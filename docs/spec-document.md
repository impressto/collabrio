# Clippy the webRTC chat with file sharing

*Technical Specification Document*

## 📋 Project Overview

This project enables two or more clients to connect directly using WebRTC and collaborate on a shared text document. When one client edits the text, the changes are instantly reflected in all other clients’ interfaces. Similarly, when a client shares a file, it becomes accessible to all participants in the session.

Additionally, a permanent storage option will allow clients to save their shared text to a server. When users return to the same session, the system can restore the document from the server, reinitializing it with the previously saved content.

### Key Details

**🎯 Purpose:** To allow one or more people to collaborate on a single body of text. 

## ⚙️ Functional Requirements

### User Stories

- 📖 As a user, I want to be able to start a new session so that I can share the link with one or more other users
- 📖 As a user, I want to be able to click a "share" button and get a QR code in a modal that I can scan with a phone.
- 📖 As a user, when webRTC is blocks, for example on a mobile network, I want to be able to fallback to using we websocket server to communicate and share files between clients

### Features

#### webRTC connection by default

The clients will have a common url, using a hack in the url, to allow them to establish a common connection via WebRTC

- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Planned

#### fallback to the use of webSockets

If webRTC is fully blocked by a mobile network, allow a fallback to using a websocket server at socket.impressto.ca. The source code for the socket server will be part of this project.

- **Priority:** High
- **Status:** Planned

#### Anonymous usage

All usage will be anonymous. Users will need the specific url and hash to share a session, but otherwise there will be no authentication

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Status:** Planned

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Architecture Overview

we will be using a client with react and for the back-end a socket server that runs on socket.impressto.ca. The socket server uses nodejs


### 💻 Technologies

#### Frontend
- React (UI framework)
- Vite (build tool and dev server)
- Yarn (package manager)

#### Backend
- Node.js (runtime)
- Socket.IO (WebSocket communication)
- Express (web server)

### 🏗️ Infrastructure

For now we will be deploying manually
